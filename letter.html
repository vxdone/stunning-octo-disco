<h4> please bear with me as i'm not really great with words. i'm more of the person who always is thinking a lot. apologies in advance CDAkjs </h4>
<h3> you know, i always thought i would never have any close friends in my life. after valerie... my self esteem went down. and during 7th grade, i'll admit, i felt very lonely. i thought no one would care if i left the friend group. this carried on until eigth grade - where i got to know you more. </h3>
<h3> you showed me what true friendship is actually like. you made me feel important and proved that i'm not a ghost. hell, you made me have another reason to live out my life. it goes to show that you've changed my life for the better. and that means a lot. like a WHOLE lot. </h3>
<h3> i know what i just wrote sounds mushy (i'm sorry), but it's true. thank you for being there when i felt down, always supporting me, helping me with my story, and giving me the best advice. you've been there with me through the ups and downs of my life. </h3>
<h3> i'm so grateful that i got to meet you and make some amazing memories together. from our inside jokes, to our talks about any random topic - you brightened my day. your presence alone is that remarkable. and get this -- you're one of the reaons that i (reluctantly) get out of bed to attend school some times... </h3>
<h3> you also literally save me from my demons 24/7 (this includes the dogs too. they're menaces i hate them so much). i am sincerely grateful for your service in providing me with the bobab milk. its taste is very refined and addictive. </h3>
<h3> ADKJSJAK im sorry for digressing a bit there but anyways -- although it's sad that i won't be able to graduate high school with you, i'll definitely cherish our times together. i hope we can continue making memories together and stay in touch. you're one of the few people that i truly appreciate for being in my life. </h3>
<h3> hope you have a splendid day and that your wishes come true. tell me all the details of your birthday celebration!! i want to hear everything about it. </h3>
<h3> cheers to our friendship, and hope that it lasts forever. </h3>
<h3> signing off, </h3>
<h2> your best friend laura :] </h2>
